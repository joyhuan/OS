# OS

Interestingly, though OS is not among my favorite CS courses (Distributed Systems and Formal Verification), it is the only course that I revisit three times within two years after taking it -- I tried different teaching styles by taking a coursera course offered by Peking University and by checking out the version taught by another professor (the amazing Professor Alvisi for Distributed Systems). Now, I am revisiting the same course that I took with Professor Robbert van Renesse. 

What, then, drives me to continuouly revisit the subject? One thing is that OS lays foundation for my love Distributed Systems. Second, it's about abstraction and design, which I appreciate so much in computer science. Third, OS demystifies how computer works. Though I'm not that into piecing up a CPU myself, I am eager to understand "Why the computer screen reflects how I type on the keyboard?", "How are the Word documents saved?", "Why some programs take so long to run that the computer starts making loud sounds?", "Why Youtube videos failed to load when Wifi is not good?"
